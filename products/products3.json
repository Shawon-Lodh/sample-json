    "description": "An ab coaster is a machine designed to work your abs in very specific ways. As opposed to other ab machines, the ab coaster works your abs from bottom to top with the help of a pendulum-like swing. To use this machine, a lifter will put their knees on a seat that is attached to the pendulum, while simultaneously holding on to bars at the top. From there, the lifter will move their knees up and down along the pendulum until they have finished their sets. This piece of equipment cost about $100 to $200.",

    "name": "Ab Crunch Machine",
    "description": "An ab crunch machine is used to work out one's upper abdominal muscles by providing an easy way for a lifter to expand and contract his core. Performing this ab crunch movement has two steps. First, the lifter must sit in the machine and slide their feet/ankles underneath the padded steps found below the machine while holding onto the bars on the top half of the machine. From there, all the lifter must do is bring their knees to their chest in an upright crunch motion. This machine costs about $500 to $1,000.",

To use this machine, the lifter must first put their feet underneath the padded bars and lay back on the bench. From there, the lifter is free to crunch, twist, or bend in any number of ways. The lifter may adjust the steepness of the bench slightly, but in all cases, the bench will remain declined. This piece of equipment costs around $50 to $150.",
